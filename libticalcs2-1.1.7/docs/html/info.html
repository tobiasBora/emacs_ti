<h1> General Information about the TiCalcs library </h1>
<hr>
<pre>&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;</em></pre>
The TiCalcs library is a part of the <a href="http://www.tilp.info">TiLP</a>
project and constitutes with the
other libraries a complete framework for developping linking and/or TI
calculator files oriented applications.<br>
<br>
<h3>Overview </h3>
The ticalcs library is a library which brings about all the functions
needed to communicate with a Texas Instruments graphing calculator (or
hand-held).
Currently, it does not support some education devices (such as CBL/CBR
and others).<br>
<br>
This library is able to communicate with handhelds in a fairly
transparent fashion. With this library, the developer does not have to worry about
the packet oriented protocol, the file management and some other stuff.<br>
The library provides a complete API which is very easy to use and makes
things easier.<br>
<br>
The library supports all the currently available calculators and their
associated file formats:<br>
- TI8x calculators: TI73, 82, 83, TI83+, 85 and 86 (with 2 sub-classes:
TI73/83+ &amp; 85/86).<br>
- TI9x calculators: TI89, 92, 92+ and V200PLT.<br>
<br>
This library has already been used by various projects (such as TiLP,
TiEmu) and by other developers. The list of developers/users can be
viewed
on the TiLP web site (Developers section).<br>
<br>
<h3></h3>
<h3>Requirements </h3>
This library is dependant of the ticonv, ticables and tifiles and GLib 2 libraries.<br>
At the time being, this library is dependant of the GLib (version 1.2),
too. The GLIb is used for its GTree capabilites. This dependancy should
be removed later with a built-in tree support.<br>
<br>
<ul>
</ul>
<h3> Bug Reports </h3>
There may still be some bugs in the library, please send an email to <a
 href="mailto:roms@tilp.info">roms</a>.<br>
<br>
<h3> History </h3>
This library is a part of the TiLP project. I have been working for 3
years on TiLP as well as on some other projects (TiEmu, TiGCC).<br>
I wroten this library for several reasons:<br>
- split code,<br>
- share code between my various project,<br>
- provide source code to others.<br>
